I named this "Duty Roster System" but it could also be referred as "Duty Reminder System" or Task Scheduler System ". 

=> THIS IS A MICROSERVICES APPLICATION.

This is a powerful software I built to cushion the effect of scheduling a system reminder or Duty reminder which can be associated with internal workings of companies or industries who rely heavily on scheduling tasks to be done by groups or individuals. An individual can also use this software to schedule a duty reminder task. 

Usually, for the roster or reminder task, email(s) are sent directly to the user email address, reminding them of the next scheduled activities or tasks.

Technologies I used for this projects are:

1. Java
2. Spring Boot 
3. Spring Data JPA
4. Java Mail Sender
5. Gmail - SMTP 
6. Kafka (for messaging and streaming)
7. Zipkin (for tracing)
8. Docker
9. MySQL 
10. Feign Client 
11. Robust Microservices Architecture (Design Pattern).
